A HTML 5 Multiplayer Game

So far the game allows for users to set a name and join the server. Players movements are synced across.


Current Issues:
Player syncing is done on each keypress, which sends a large amount of network traffic, going to have to adapt a way of only sending when a player presses the key, and then lets go of the key.
